    "However, the performance benefits are remarkable. The first problem in this\n",
    "problem set highlighted just how much more powerful the GPU is than the CPU.\n",
    "Despite its power the GPU does have its drawback. Besides being hard to code,\n",
    "not everything can be parallelized effectively. Code that contains lots of\n",
    "branching or relies heavily on being in synch at certain times is a job better\n",
    "left for the CPU. In addition we see that while the GPU is a very powerful tool\n",
    "it must be used correctly. This is exemplified in Problem 3 where choosing the\n",
    "number of threads per block impacts the performance of the problem in a\n",
    "non-trivial manner. The graph clearly demonstrates that when the number of\n",
    "threads in the block is a multiple of 32 the performance is better. Thus\n",
    "highlights that choosing and running CUDA code is not a trivial manner. Thought\n",
